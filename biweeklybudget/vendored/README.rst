biweeklybudget vendored requirements
====================================

This directory contains dependencies that, for one reason or another, can't
be directly installed from PyPI (usually, packages that either we've forked and
aren't responding to pull requests, or packages that haven't uploaded a recent
release to PyPI).

For information on updating these packages, see the
`Development - Vendored Requirements <http://biweeklybudget.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html#vendored-requirements>`_
section of the documentation.

For the licenses that each of these dependencies are distributed under, see
``vendored_requirements.txt`` or the individual package directories.
